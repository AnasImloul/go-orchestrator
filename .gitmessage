# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat: A new feature
# * fix: A bug fix
# * docs: Documentation only changes
# * style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# * perf: A code change that improves performance
# * test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# * chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
#
# Scope should be the area of the codebase affected (e.g., di, lifecycle, orchestrator)
# Subject should be a short description of the change
# Body should provide more detail about the change
# Footer should contain any breaking changes or issue references

# Examples:
# feat(di): add support for scoped services
# fix(lifecycle): resolve deadlock in component disposal
